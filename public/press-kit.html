        <h2>Full Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Cache McClure is a science fiction author whose work explores the complex relationships between technology, humanity, and the future we're building. With a background in software engineering and a lifelong passion for speculative fiction, Cache brings a unique technical authenticity to stories that examine how innovation reshapes society, identity, and what it means to be human.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drawing inspiration from the masters of hard science fiction and cyberpunk, Cache crafts narratives that balance rigorous extrapolation with deeply human stories. The result is fiction that feels both grounded in possibility and limitless in imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cache's journey into science fiction writing began with a simple question: "What if?" As a software engineer, the daily work of building systems and solving problems naturally led to wondering about the long-term consequences of our technological choices. Science fiction became the perfect medium to explore these questions—not just as thought experiments, but as fully realized worlds where characters must navigate the opportunities and dangers of innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Fracture Engines</strong> series represents years of development, combining Cache's technical expertise with a deep love for character-driven storytelling. Each book explores different facets of a future where technology has fundamentally altered humanity's trajectory, asking difficult questions about progress, power, and the price of advancement.

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Synopsis</h4>
            <p>
                In a post-singularity universe where an ancient civilization accidentally shattered reality into twelve parallel layers, the fate of all existence hangs in the balance. Captain Veyra Krost leads the 77th Breacher Company—eight soldiers from different layers of reality, each with unique abilities shaped by their fractured worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
                When routine maintenance on a Fracture Engine reveals evidence of sabotage, the squad uncovers a conspiracy that threatens to accelerate the convergence of all layers—an event that would annihilate billions across multiple realities. As they hunt for answers across parallel worlds where physics itself changes, they must navigate not only hostile environments but also the political factions fighting for control of humanity's fate.

        <h2>Writing Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            Science fiction is more than entertainment—it's a vital tool for thinking about who we are and who we might become. In an era of rapid technological change, SF provides a framework for exploring the implications of innovation before they arrive on our doorstep.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cache's work sits at the intersection of <strong>hard science fiction</strong>, <strong>cyberpunk</strong>, and <strong>philosophical speculation</strong>, creating stories that are as intellectually engaging as they are emotionally resonant. The goal is always to write fiction that entertains while making readers think—and maybe see the present a little differently.
