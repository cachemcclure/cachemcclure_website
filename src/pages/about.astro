        <p class="mb-4">
          Cache McClure is a science fiction author whose work explores the
          complex relationships between technology, humanity, and the future we're
          building. With a background in software engineering and a lifelong
          passion for speculative fiction, Cache brings a unique technical
          authenticity to stories that examine how innovation reshapes society,
          identity, and what it means to be human.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Drawing inspiration from the masters of hard science fiction and
          cyberpunk, Cache crafts narratives that balance rigorous extrapolation
          with deeply human stories. The result is fiction that feels both
          grounded in possibility and limitless in imagination.

        <h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold sm:text-2xl">The Writing Journey</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Cache's journey into science fiction writing began with a simple
          question: "What if?" As a software engineer, the daily work of building
          systems and solving problems naturally led to wondering about the
          long-term consequences of our technological choices. Science fiction
          became the perfect medium to explore these questions—not just as
          thought experiments, but as fully realized worlds where characters must
          navigate the opportunities and dangers of innovation.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The <strong>Fracture Engines</strong> series represents years of
          development, combining Cache's technical expertise with a deep love for
          character-driven storytelling. Each book explores different facets of a
          future where technology has fundamentally altered humanity's trajectory,
          asking difficult questions about progress, power, and the price of
          advancement.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          When not writing, Cache can be found exploring the latest developments
          in AI, quantum computing, and space exploration—always with an eye
          toward the stories these technologies might tell in the years to come.

          Why Science Fiction?
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Science fiction is more than entertainment—it's a vital tool for
          thinking about who we are and who we might become. In an era of rapid
          technological change, SF provides a framework for exploring the
          implications of innovation before they arrive on our doorstep. It asks
          the questions that matter: How will AI change the nature of work and
          identity? What happens when we can engineer our own biology? How do we
          maintain our humanity in an increasingly digital world?
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Cache's work sits at the intersection of <strong
            >hard science fiction</strong
          >, <strong>cyberpunk</strong>, and <strong
            >philosophical speculation</strong
          >, creating stories that are as intellectually engaging as they are
          emotionally resonant. The goal is always to write fiction that
          entertains while making readers think—and maybe see the present a
          little differently.
