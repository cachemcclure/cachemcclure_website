This is a medium-length news post designed to test the reading time calculation feature. It contains enough content to generate a reading time of several minutes, allowing us to verify that the calculation is accurate and displays correctly.

## Background

The reading time feature is calculated based on an industry-standard reading speed of 200 words per minute. This provides readers with a quick estimate of how long it will take them to read the entire post.

## Implementation Details

The calculation strips HTML tags and Markdown syntax to count only the actual readable words. This ensures accurate estimates regardless of formatting. The system also normalizes whitespace and handles edge cases like empty content or very short posts.

### Key Features

- Accurate word counting that strips markup
- Minimum 1-minute read time for short posts
- Rounds up to the nearest minute
- Accessible ARIA labels for screen readers
- Clean, unobtrusive display in the post metadata

## Why Reading Time Matters

Reading time estimates help readers decide whether they have enough time to read a post right now or should save it for later. It's a small UX enhancement that can improve engagement and user satisfaction.

Studies show that posts with reading time estimates tend to have better completion rates because readers can make informed decisions about when to consume the content.

## Future Enhancements

We could potentially add features like:

- Reading speed customization (slow, medium, fast)
- Progress indicators as users scroll
- Total reading time for article series
- Estimated time remaining as users read

But for now, the simple reading time display provides good value without adding complexity.

## Conclusion

This medium-length post should display a reading time of approximately 2-3 minutes, demonstrating that the calculation works correctly for content of various lengths. The feature integrates seamlessly into the existing news post layout without disrupting the reading experience.
