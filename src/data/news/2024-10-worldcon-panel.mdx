Excited to announce that I'll be participating in **WorldCon 2024** in Glasgow, Scotland this December!

## Panel Details

**Panel**: "Coding Consciousness: AI Ethics in Contemporary SF"
**Date**: December 14, 2024
**Time**: 2:00 PM GMT
**Location**: SEC Centre, Panel Room 3B

I'll be joined by some incredible authors and thinkers to discuss how science fiction is grappling with questions of artificial intelligence, consciousness, and ethics in an era where these aren't just thought experiments—they're becoming daily headlines.

## Discussion Topics

We'll be exploring:

- How has SF's portrayal of AI evolved from the "robot uprising" tropes?
- What responsibility do we have as authors when writing about emerging technologies?
- Can fiction help us navigate the real ethical dilemmas we're facing?
- The difference between artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness
- Where do we draw the line at personhood?

## My Perspective

Having written *Echoes of Memory* and now working on *The Neural Uprising*, I've spent a lot of time thinking about these questions. Not just in terms of plot devices, but in terms of genuine moral philosophy.

I don't think the goal is to predict the future (we're terrible at that). The goal is to explore the *questions* we'll need to ask ourselves as these technologies develop. Science fiction is a safe space to run thought experiments that would be too risky or unethical to run in real life.

## Meeting Readers

I'll be at the conference all weekend (December 12-15), so if you're attending, please come say hi! I'll be doing a signing at the Dealers' Room on Saturday afternoon, and I'm always happy to chat between panels.

## Can't Make It?

The panel will be recorded and made available on the WorldCon website about a month after the event. I'll share the link when it's up!
