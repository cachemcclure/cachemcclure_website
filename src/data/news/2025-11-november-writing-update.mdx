## Current Projects

Happy November, everyone! Thought it was time for an update on what I'm working on and what's coming up.

### The Synthetic Soul (Digital Conscience Trilogy #2)

The first draft is complete! I'm currently in the revision phase, and I have to say, this book has been both easier and harder than *The Neural Uprising*. Easier because the world is already established, but harder because the stakes need to escalate while staying true to the characters and themes.

**Current word count**: 98,000 words (target is around 105,000)

**Expected release**: Fall 2025

Without spoiling anything, I can tell you that Book Two dives deeper into the question of what consciousness really means, and whether the distinction between "natural" and "artificial" intelligence is as meaningful as we think. Maya Chen returns, of course, but she's not the same person she was at the end of Book One.

### What I'm Reading

I've been doing a lot of research for Book Three, which means I've been deep in:

- **The Alignment Problem** by Brian Christian
- **Life 3.0** by Max Tegmark
- Various papers on consciousness and embodied cognition

It's fascinating how the science keeps evolving. Some of the things I wrote in *The Neural Uprising* that felt like speculation are already happening in limited forms.

## Upcoming Events

### Virtual Author Chat - November 20

I'll be doing a live Q&A on [Platform] at 7 PM EST. Bring your questions about the books, the writing process, or anything else!

### Holiday Sale

*Echoes of Memory* will be on sale for $0.99 throughout the week of Thanksgiving. Perfect time to catch up if you haven't read it yet, or to gift it to a sci-fi loving friend!

## What's On My Mind

I've been thinking a lot about pacing lately—both in writing and in life. There's this pressure to constantly be producing, constantly be promoting, constantly be "on." But the best writing happens when I give myself space to think, to let ideas percolate, to read without immediately wondering "how can I use this?"

So that's my reminder to myself (and maybe to you): it's okay to slow down. The story will be better for it.

Until next time,
