## Four Fancy Hardback Covers

Just made some cool new options for cover art for the hardback edition of Fracture Engine! I tried to include several
different color palettes with designs that represented the layout and interactions of the layers.

Here's my first attempt, which I feel would look great using embossed gold, copper, etc. for the rings so you can feel
the different layers right on the cover:

This next attempt displays the instability and overlap of the different layers:

For this cover, I wanted to go with a very minimal approach, adding a sense of mystery while still touching on the
concept of different layers around a midpoint:

And finally, this cover was meant to take a negative approach, using a bright background and a central design again:
