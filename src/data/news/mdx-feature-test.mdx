## Typography Test

This is a comprehensive test post to verify that all MDX features are rendering correctly with the Tailwind Typography plugin.

### All Heading Levels

# Heading Level 1
## Heading Level 2
### Heading Level 3
#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5
###### Heading Level 6

### Text Formatting

This is a paragraph with **bold text**, *italic text*, ***bold and italic text***, and ~~strikethrough text~~.

You can also use `inline code` within sentences. This is useful for referencing function names like `getStaticPaths()` or variables like `const myVariable = 42;`.

### Lists

#### Unordered List

- First item
- Second item with **bold text**
- Third item with *italic text*
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
    - Deeply nested item
- Fourth item with a [link](#)

#### Ordered List

1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item
3. Third ordered item
   1. Nested ordered item
   2. Another nested item
4. Fourth ordered item

#### Task List

- [ ] Unchecked task
- [x] Checked task
- [ ] Another unchecked task

### Links

Here are some different types of links:

- [Internal link to books](/books)
- [Internal link to about page](/about)
- [External link to GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Link with title](https://example.com "Example Website")

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It can contain multiple paragraphs and other elements.
>
> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.
>
> — Attribution Source

Nested blockquotes:

> First level quote
>> Second level quote
>>> Third level quote

### Code Blocks

#### Inline Code

Use `console.log()` to print to the console.

#### JavaScript Code Block

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome, ${name}`;
}

const result = greet("World");
```

#### TypeScript Code Block

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function createUser(name: string, email: string): User {
  return {
    id: Math.random(),
    name,
    email,
  };
}
```

#### Python Code Block

```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    """Calculate factorial recursively"""
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * calculate_factorial(n - 1)

result = calculate_factorial(5)
print(f"Factorial: {result}")
```

#### Code Block with Highlighting

```javascript
// This line should be highlighted // [!code highlight]
function important() {
  return "This is important";
}
```

### Horizontal Rules

Here's a horizontal rule:

And another one:

***

### Tables

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| MDX Rendering | ✅ Complete | High |
| Typography Plugin | ✅ Complete | High |
| Code Highlighting | ✅ Complete | High |
| Image Support | 🔄 Testing | Medium |

#### Table with Alignment

| Left Aligned | Center Aligned | Right Aligned |
|:-------------|:--------------:|--------------:|
| Left | Center | Right |
| A | B | C |

### Images

Here's a standard image:

![Alt text for image](/images/test-image.jpg)

Here's an image with a caption:

![Book cover](/ /fracture-engine.svg)
*Caption: This is a test image caption*

### Combinations

Here's a list with various formatting:

1. **Bold item** with a [link](#)
2. *Italic item* with `inline code`
3. Item with a blockquote:
   > This is quoted text within a list

### Escape Characters

You can escape special characters: \* \_ \` \[ \]

### HTML in MDX

You can also use HTML elements:

<div style="padding: 1rem; border: 2px solid var(--color-accent); border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This is an HTML div element with custom styling.
</div>

### Details/Summary (Collapsible)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

This content is hidden by default and can be toggled by clicking the summary.

- You can include lists
- **Formatted text**
- And other markdown elements

</details>

### Definition Lists

Term 1
: Definition for term 1

Term 2
: Definition for term 2
: Another definition for term 2

### Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote[^1].

And here's another with a longer footnote[^longer-note].

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^longer-note]: This is a longer footnote with multiple paragraphs.

    You can indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

### Special Characters and Symbols

© 2025 · → ← ↑ ↓ · • · ★ ☆ · ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ · α β γ δ · ∞ ≈ ≠ ≤ ≥

### Emoji Support

👋 Hello! 🚀 Launch successful! ✅ Tests passing! 🎉 Celebration time!

### Math (requires additional plugins)

Note: Math rendering would require `remark-math` and `rehype-katex` plugins.

For now, we can show math as code:
- Inline: `E = mc^2`
- Block equation: `∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^{-x²} dx = √π`

## Conclusion

This test post covers all major MDX features. If you can see this content rendered properly with appropriate styling, the MDX integration is working correctly!
