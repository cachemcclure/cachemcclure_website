## Synopsis

In the memory markets of 2038 Los Angeles, detective Aria Santos specializes in authentication—verifying that extracted memories are genuine and not fabricated. It's a job that requires navigating the murky ethics of a world where the wealthy can buy experiences they never lived, and the desperate can sell their most precious moments for survival.

When a series of illegal memory extractions leaves victims in vegetative states, Aria is assigned to the case. But as she digs deeper, she uncovers something far more sinister: someone is harvesting memories to construct a new identity, piece by stolen piece. And the composite person they're building has an impossible goal—to remember a future that hasn't happened yet.

As the investigation spirals into conspiracy, Aria must question everything she knows about memory, identity, and reality itself. Because in a world where memories can be bought and sold, how do you know which ones are truly yours?
