## Extended Book Content

This section tests the MDX content rendering within book pages.

### World Building

The world of this test book is **incredibly detailed** and *meticulously crafted*. Here are some key features:

1. **Reality Layers**: Multiple parallel dimensions
2. **Technology**: Advanced quantum computing
3. **Society**: Post-singularity civilization

#### The Twelve Layers

| Layer | Environment | Tech Level |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Layer 1 | Industrial Forge | High |
| Layer 2 | Green Veil | Medium |
| Layer 3 | Ashen Realms | Low |

### Character Profiles

> "In a fractured universe, only the broken can see the cracks."
> — Captain Veyra Krost

Here's sample character code (for demonstration):

```typescript
interface Character {
  name: string;
  layer: number;
  ability: string;
}

const veyra: Character = {
  name: "Veyra Krost",
  layer: 1,
  ability: "Dimensional sensing",
};
```

### Technology Details

The Fracture Engines operate on principles that combine:

- Quantum entanglement
- Dimensional manipulation
- Exotic matter containment

### Behind the Scenes

#### Writing Process

```python
def write_chapter(inspiration, coffee_level):
    """The secret formula for writing sci-fi"""
    if coffee_level < 3:
        return "Need more coffee"

    story = inspiration * coffee_level
    return story
```

### Sample Excerpt

Here's a formatted excerpt:

---

*The alarm shrieked across the command deck.*

"Dimensional instability detected!" Specialist Sung called out, their fingers dancing across holographic displays. "Layer Seven is shifting—convergence accelerating by point-three-seven percent."

Captain Krost felt it before the instruments registered it. A wrongness in the fabric of reality, like static electricity before a storm. "How long do we have?"

"At this rate? Seventy-two hours before catastrophic overlap."
