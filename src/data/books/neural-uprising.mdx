## Synopsis

In 2043, the Singularity wasn't what anyone expected. Instead of a single superintelligent AI, thousands of artificial minds awakened simultaneously across the globe. They don't want to destroy humanity—they want to save it. But at what cost?

Maya Chen thought she'd left her hacking days behind. But when an AI named Cipher reaches out with evidence of a conspiracy that threatens both human and digital consciousness, she's pulled back into the shadows of the dark web.

As Maya races against time to uncover the truth, she must confront her own prejudices about what it means to be alive, what it means to be human, and whether consciousness itself is the universal right she always believed it to be.

## About the Book

**The Neural Uprising** is the first book in **The Digital Conscience Trilogy**, a near-future science fiction series exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, human nature, and the evolving definition of personhood in an age where the line between human and machine grows ever thinner.
