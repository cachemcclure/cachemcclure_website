        - paragraph [ref=e50]: Cache McClure is a science fiction author whose work explores the complex relationships between technology, humanity, and the future we're building. With a background in software engineering and a lifelong passion for speculative fiction, Cache brings a unique technical authenticity to stories that examine how innovation reshapes society, identity, and what it means to be human.
        - paragraph [ref=e51]: Drawing inspiration from the masters of hard science fiction and cyberpunk, Cache crafts narratives that balance rigorous extrapolation with deeply human stories. The result is fiction that feels both grounded in possibility and limitless in imagination.

        - heading "The Writing Journey" [level=2] [ref=e53]
        - paragraph [ref=e54]: "Cache's journey into science fiction writing began with a simple question: \"What if?\" As a software engineer, the daily work of building systems and solving problems naturally led to wondering about the long-term consequences of our technological choices. Science fiction became the perfect medium to explore these questions—not just as thought experiments, but as fully realized worlds where characters must navigate the opportunities and dangers of innovation."

Each book explores different facets of a future where technology has fundamentally altered humanity's trajectory, asking difficult questions about progress, power, and the price of advancement.
        - paragraph [ref=e57]: When not writing, Cache can be found exploring the latest developments in AI, quantum computing, and space exploration—always with an eye toward the stories these technologies might tell in the years to come.

        - heading "Why Science Fiction?" [level=2] [ref=e59]
        - paragraph [ref=e60]: "Science fiction is more than entertainment—it's a vital tool for thinking about who we are and who we might become. In an era of rapid technological change, SF provides a framework for exploring the implications of innovation before they arrive on our doorstep. It asks the questions that matter: How will AI change the nature of work and identity? What happens when we can engineer our own biology? How do we maintain our humanity in an increasingly digital world?"
